## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This is a MERN stack application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. The user is then able to signup, then login in with those same credentials, and then save books for purchase. Users are also able to retrieve saved books and delete them from their lists. The front-end of the application was built using REACT where the back-end uses a MongoDB database and express js API. The code was refactored from a Restful API to GraphQL and Apollo Server.
